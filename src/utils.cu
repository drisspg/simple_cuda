 * @brief Measures the execution time of a CUDA kernel.
 *
 * This function measures the execution time of a CUDA kernel by recording
 * CUDA events before and after the kernel launch. The time is measured in
 * milliseconds.
 *
 * @param kernelLauncher A std::function object that launches the CUDA kernel.
 * This function should take no arguments and have no return value. The
 * function should launch the CUDA kernel with the desired grid and block
 * dimensions.
 *
 * @return The execution time of the CUDA kernel in milliseconds.
 *
 * @note The caller is responsible for ensuring that any device memory
 * accessed by the kernel is allocated before this function is called and
 * deallocated after this function returns. The caller is also responsible
 * for handling any CUDA errors that may occur during the kernel execution.
